## Hi there! I'm Amina, a 3rd year Computer Science Major at UC Irvine.
I love computer science, design, and implementing AI in ethical ways. I’m especially interested in the spaces where these passions intersect, and I’m always working on projects that help me learn and strengthen my skills.

Feel free to explore my repositories to see what I’m currently building (and what I’ve worked on so far).
